/* THESE ARE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:
Runner class is a way to run your all features files from here.Regression,smoke,integration...etc
@RunWith-->annotation comes from Junit and it executes the feature file steps.
@CucumberOptions--> is a special annotation that have some keywords.
  features-->this is the location of feature files(this one should be content root)
  glue-->this is the location of step definition files(this one should be source root)
  dryRun-->this is a way to get snips(steps) without executing the whole implementation
  tags-->is a way to specialize scenarios for the specific purposes.It means you can run for some
  scenario/s for only regression,smoke or etc.
  plugin-->is a way to integrate specific condition for the keyword. It is mostly used to create a report card.
